No one here but us chickens!

I really enjoy making, and eating, ice cream! My favorite ice cream shop is either Mallard's in Bellingham, or Salt & Straw, in Portland. When I make ice cream on my own, my favorite flavor to make is goat cheese ice cream (and I usually drizzle honey or caramel in it)!
